                            <p>Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a leafy green flowering plant native to central and
                                western Asia. It is of the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, subfamily
                                Chenopodioideae. Its leaves are a common edible vegetable consumed either fresh, or
                                after storage using preservation techniques by canning, freezing, or dehydration. It may
                                be eaten cooked or raw, and the taste differs considerably; the high oxalate content may
                                be reduced by steaming.
                                It is an annual plant (rarely biennial), growing as tall as 30 cm (1 ft). Spinach may
                                overwinter in temperate regions. The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular,
                                and very variable in size: 2–30 cm (1–12 in) long and 1–15 cm (0.4–5.9 in) broad, with
                                larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem.
                                The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) in diameter, and mature
                                into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit cluster 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) across containing
                                several seeds.
                                In 2018, world production of spinach was 26.3 million tonnes, with China alone
                                accounting for 90% of the total.

                                <p>Cabbage, comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, is a leafy green, red
                                    (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for
                                    its dense-leaved heads. It is descended from the wild cabbage (B. oleracea var.
                                    oleracea), and belongs to the "cole crops" or brassicas, meaning it is closely
                                    related to broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var.
                                    gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage (var. sabauda).
                                    A cabbage generally weighs between 500 to 1,000 grams (1 to 2 lb). Smooth-leafed,
                                    firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages
                                    and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer. Under conditions of
                                    long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages
                                    can grow quite large. As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 kilograms (138 lb 4
                                    oz). Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's life
                                    cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be
                                    kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone
                                    to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and
                                    fungal diseases.

                                        <p>Watercress or yellowcress is a species of aquatic flowering plant in the
                                            cabbage family Brassicaceae. Its botanical name is Nasturtium officinale.
                                            Watercress is a rapidly growing, perennial plant native to Europe and Asia.
                                            It is one of the oldest known leaf vegetables consumed by humans. Watercress
                                            and many of its relatives, such as garden cress, mustard, radish, and
                                            wasabi, are noteworthy for their piquant flavors.
                                            The hollow stems of watercress float in water. The leaf structure is
                                            pinnately compound. Small, white, and green flowers are produced in clusters
                                            and are frequently visited by insects, especially hoverflies, such as
                                            Eristalis flies. Eating watercress can help support the health of your
                                            heart. Antioxidants (carotenoids in particular) have been linked to lower
                                            blood pressure, lower risk of heart disease, and even a lower risk of heart
                                            attacks and strokes.

                                            <p>Romaine or cos lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia) is a variety
                                                of lettuce that grows in a tall head of sturdy dark green leaves with
                                                firm ribs down their centers. Unlike most lettuces, it is tolerant of
                                                heat. In North America, romaine is sold as whole heads or as “hearts”
                                                that have had the outer leaves removed and are often packaged together.
                                                Commercially sold romaine lettuce has occasionally been the subject of
                                                product warnings by both U.S. and Canadian health authorities warning
                                                that consumer supplies can become contaminated with or host pathogenic
                                                E. coli bacteria. Cattle can harbor the bacteria without ill effects,
                                                and be asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium. Lettuce becomes
                                                contaminated with the bacterium as the result of cattle manure being
                                                used to fertilize crop fields, or the proximity of cattle pastures and
                                                feedlots to water sources used to irrigate crops. Although it's low in
                                                fiber, it's high in minerals, such as calcium, phosphorous, magnesium,
                                                and potassium. It's naturally low in sodium. Plus, romaine lettuce is
                                                packed with vitamin C, vitamin K, and folate. It's a good source of beta
                                                carotene, which converts into vitamin A in the body.

                                                <p>Kale, or leaf cabbage, belongs to a group of cabbage (Brassica
                                                    oleracea) cultivars grown for their edible leaves, although some are
                                                    used as ornamentals. Kale plants have green or purple leaves, and
                                                    the central leaves do not form a head (as with headed cabbage).
                                                    Kales are considered to be closer to wild cabbage than most of the
                                                    many domesticated forms of Brassica oleracea. Kale is usually an
                                                    annual plant grown from seed with a wide range of germination
                                                    temperatures. It is hardy and thrives in wintertime, and can survive
                                                    in temperatures as low as –15.0° Celsius. Kale can become sweeter in
                                                    taste after a heavy frost. benefits of Kale include helping manage
                                                    blood pressure, boosting digestive health, and protecting against
                                                    cancer and type 2 diabetes.

                                                    <p>Coriander is an herb that's commonly used to flavor international
                                                        dishes. It comes from the Coriandrum sativum plant and is
                                                        related to parsley, carrots, and celery. In the United States,
                                                        Coriandrum sativum seeds are called coriander, while its leaves
                                                        are called cilantro. The plant is also known as Chinese parsley.
                                                        Coriander is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae. It is also
                                                        known as Chinese parsley, dhania or cilantro. All parts of the
                                                        plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds (as a
                                                        spice) are the parts most traditionally used in cooking.
                                                        Most people perceive the taste of coriander leaves as a tart,
                                                        lemon/lime taste, but to nearly a quarter of those surveyed, the
                                                        leaves taste like dish soap, linked to a gene which detects some
                                                        specific aldehydes that are also used as odorant substances in
                                                        many soaps and detergents. Raw coriander leaves are 92% water,
                                                        4% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and less than 1% fat (table). The
                                                        nutritional profile of coriander seeds is different from the
                                                        fresh stems or leaves. In a 100-gram (3+1⁄2 oz) reference
                                                        amount, leaves are particularly rich in vitamin A, vitamin C and
                                                        vitamin K, with moderate content of dietary minerals (table).
                                                        Although seeds generally have lower vitamin content, they do
                                                        provide significant amounts of dietary fiber, calcium, selenium,

Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea. Broccoli has large flower heads, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk which is usually light green. The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves. Broccoli resembles cauliflower, which is a different, but closely related cultivar group of the same Brassica species.It is eaten either raw or cooked. Broccoli is a particularly rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K. Contents of its characteristic sulfur-containing glucosinolate compounds, isothiocyanates and sulforaphane, are diminished by boiling, but are better preserved by steaming, microwaving or stir-frying. A 100 gram reference serving of raw broccoli provides 34 calories and is a rich source (20% or higher of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (107% DV) and vitamin K (97% DV) (table). Raw broccoli also contains moderate amounts (10–19% DV) of several B vitamins and the dietary mineral manganese, whereas other micronutrients are low in content (less than 10% DV). Raw broccoli is 89% water, 7% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contains negligible fat (table).

Chinensis varieties do not form heads and have green leaf blades with lighter bulbous bottoms instead, forming a cluster reminiscent of mustard greens. Chinensis varieties are popular in southern China, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Being winter-hardy, they are increasingly grown in Northern Europe. Now considered a subspecies of Brassica rapa, this group was originally classified as its own species under the name Brassica chinensis by Carl Linnaeus.[citation needed] They are a member of the family of Brassicaceae or Cruciferae, also commonly known as the mustards, the crucifers, or the cabbage family. Raw bok choy is 95% water, 2% carbohydrates, 1% protein and less than 1% fat (table). In a 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference serving, raw bok choy provides 54 kilojoules (13 kilocalories) of food energy and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A (30% DV), vitamin C (54% DV) and vitamin K (44% DV), while providing folate, vitamin B6 and calcium in moderate amounts (10–17% DV) (see table). Bok choy contains glucosinolates. These compounds have been reported to prevent cancer[citation needed] in small doses, but, like many substances, can be toxic to humans in large doses, particularly to people who are already seriously ill. In 2009, an elderly diabetic woman who had been consuming 1 to 1.5 kilograms (2 lb 3 oz to 3 lb 5 oz) of raw bok choy per day in an attempt to treat her diabetes developed hypothyroidism for reasons relating to her diabetes,[citation needed] resulting in myxedema coma. According to the case study published by her treating physicians, raw bok choy releases an enzyme which can inhibit the uptake of iodine, when eaten in large amounts over extended periods.

Common chicory includes types such as radicchio, puntarelle, and Belgian endive.There is considerable confusion between Cichorium endivia and Cichorium intybus.

The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus is native to Eurasia and North America, but the two most commonplace species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), were introduced into North America from Europe and now propagate as wildflowers. Both species are edible in their entirety. The common name dandelion (/ˈdændɪlaɪ.ən/ DAN-di-ly-ən, from French dent-de-lion, meaning 'lion's tooth') is also given to specific members of the genus. Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant. In general, the leaves are 50–250 millimetres (2–10 in) long or longer, simple, lobed, and form a basal rosette above the central taproot. The flower heads are yellow to orange coloured, and are open in the daytime, but closed at night. The heads are borne singly on a hollow stem (scape) that is usually leafless and rises 10–100 millimetres (3⁄8–3+7⁄8 in) or more[4] above the leaves. Stems and leaves exude a white, milky latex when broken. A rosette may produce several flowering stems at a time. The flower heads are 20–50 millimetres (3⁄4–2 in) in diameter and consist entirely of ray florets. The flower heads mature into spherical seed heads sometimes called blowballs or clocks (in both British and American English) containing many single-seeded fruits called achenes. Each achene is attached to a pappus of fine hair-like material which enables wind-aided dispersal over long distances.[citation needed]
